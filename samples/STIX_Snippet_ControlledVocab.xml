	This snippet demonstrates how users should use controlled vocabularies in STIX:
	
	1. Define the namespace prefix for XMLSchema-instance (xsi is the preferred prefix)
	2. Define the namespace prefix for the vocabulary you wish to use (most likely the STIX default vocabularies)
	3. Include a schema location for the vocabulary you wish to use
	4. Set the xsi:type attribute of the element you're using the vocabulary on to the type of the vocabulary.
	5. Set the value of the element to the item from the vocabulary you wish to use.
	
	In many cases, this information (filename, namespace, and element name) for the default vocabulary is included in the schema annotations for the element itself.
