			<xs:documentation>The SimpleMarkingStructureType extends the Data Marking MarkingStructureType and is a basic implementation of the Data Marking data model that allows for a string statement to be associated with the data being marked. It is contained in the simpleMarking namespace. One example is the application of a copyright statement to some data set.  </xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation>Nodes may be marked by multiple Simple Marking statements. When this occurs, all of the multiple Simple Marking statements apply. It is up to the organization adding an additional Simple Marking statement to ensure that the addition does not conflict with any previously applied Simple Marking statements.</xs:documentation>
