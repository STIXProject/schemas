			<xs:documentation>The TermsOfUseMarkingStructureType extends the Data Marking MarkingStructureType and is a basic implementation of the Data Marking data model that allows for a string statement describing the Terms of Use to be associated with the data being marked.  It is contained in the TOUMarking namespace.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation>Nodes may be marked by multiple Terms of Use Marking statements. When this occurs, all of the multiple Terms of Use Marking statements apply. It is up to the organization adding an additional Terms of Use Marking statement to ensure that the addition does not conflict with any previously applied Terms of Use Marking statements.</xs:documentation>
