			<xs:documentation>The TermsOfUseMarkingStructureType is a basic implementation of the data marking schema that allows for a string statement describing the Terms Of Use to be associated with the data being marked.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation>Nodes may be marked by multiple Terms Of Use Marking statements. When this occurs, all of the multiple Terms of Use Marking statements apply. Its up to the organization adding an additional Term Of User Marking statement to ensure that it's Terms Of Use does not conflict with any previously applied Terms Of Use Marking Statement.</xs:documentation>
